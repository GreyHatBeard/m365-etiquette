## Should I create a Microsoft Team, a Channel or a Private Channel?
I have a project with different areas of focus, e.g. Development, Sales, Marketing, Support
- Create a Microsoft Team for the project
- Create a different Channel for each area of focus
- Create a single Planner and use labels to allow the tasks to be filtered for each area
- Create a separate OneNote section for each Channel
