# The etiquette of Microsoft 365
Have you ever wanted a set of policies around how people should use Office 365/Microsoft 365? Do you find yourself repeating the same little bits of advice to people again and again and again? We're not talking about adoption specifically here, more about "Hey, you should always make sure you reply to a conversation in Teams rather than starting a new one" or "Keep files just for you in OneDrive and move them to the appropriate team's SharePoint when you want to work together". Wouldn't it be great if there was a place to get all these useful suggestions in one place?

Welcome to the etiquette of Microsoft 365!

## Aim
The purpose of this site is to be able to collect and share all those useful suggestions for the right way to use Microsoft 365 services and put them in a way that you can choose the ones for your organisation and share.

At the moment, these are all in Github and can be copied as markdown files from there but the attention is to be able to create downloadable packages so you can host your own site similar to this but also have it on SharePoint or in Teams so it is there front and centre.

What is even better is that we want this to be community driven so if you have your own tips, then feel free to add them. If you have a good idea on how to share them internally, raise an issue and then get started with building it. Sharing is Caring.

## Structure

The tips are broken down in to specific services or approaches although this may evolve over time, especially where some tips will overlap both.

#### By Service
- [Outlook](By-service/outlook)
- [Teams](By-service/teams)
- [OneNote](By-service/onenote)
- [Planner](By-service/planner)

#### By Approach
- [Communicating](By-approach/communicating)
- [Files](By-approach/files)
- [Voice](By-approach/voice)
