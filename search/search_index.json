This isn't about the technical implementations, it is about how people can best work together with the services available and in ways that keep everyone happy. The original list originated from a brain splurge by Al on a long train journey and then was extended during a podcast with Garry and Kevin who were joined by Marijn Somers for an episode of the GreyHatBeard podcast. This triggered an idea of this repository and site where others can held build up a community driven collection of great advice. The more hints and tips that can be combined, the more rounded the advice can be. Over time, we hope that this will evolve so that the content can be used within your own organisations, through extracts, SharePoint WebParts and other ways to re-use the list. This may be a complete extract or a selection of the useful elements that you would like to include.
