Do you find yourself repeating the same little bits of advice to people again and again and again? We're not talking about adoption specifically here, more about \"Hey, you should always make sure you reply to a conversation in Teams rather than starting a new one\" or \"Keep files just for you in OneDrive and move them to the appropriate team's SharePoint when you want to work together\". Wouldn't it be great if there was a place to get all these useful suggestions in one place? Welcome to the etiquette of Microsoft 365! Aim \u00b6 The purpose of this site is to be able to collect and share all those useful suggestions for the right way to use Microsoft 365 services and put them in a way that you can choose the ones for your organisation and share. At the moment, these are all in Github and can be copied as markdown files from there but the attention is to be able to create downloadable packages so you can host your own site similar to this but also have it on SharePoint or in Teams so it is there front and centre. What is even better is that we want this to be community driven so if you have your own tips, then feel free to add them. If you have a good idea on how to share them internally, raise an issue and then get started with building it. Sharing is Caring. Structure \u00b6 The tips are broken down in to specific services or approaches although this may evolve over time, especially where some tips will overlap both. By Service \u00b6 Outlook Teams OneNote Planner By Approach \u00b6 Asking questions Communicating Files Liking posts Voice Working out loud Contributing \u00b6 There are three options for contributing: Using GitHub Fill out a form Send a tweet with #M365Etiquette Our preferred way is in GitHub but we know that isn't for everyone so scroll further down for simpler options.

This isn't about the technical implementations, it is about how people can best work together with the services available and in ways that keep everyone happy. The original list originated from a brain splurge by Al on a long train journey and then was extended during a podcast with Garry and Kevin who were joined by Marijn Somers for an episode of the GreyHatBeard podcast. This triggered an idea of this repository and site where others can held build up a community driven collection of great advice. The more hints and tips that can be combined, the more rounded the advice can be. Over time, we hope that this will evolve so that the content can be used within your own organisations, through extracts, SharePoint WebParts and other ways to re-use the list. This may be a complete extract or a selection of the useful elements that you would like to include. For now, please use the etiquette tips and help to contribute your own items through Pull Requests. Any suggestions?
