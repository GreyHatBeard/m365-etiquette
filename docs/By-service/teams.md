# Microsoft Teams

## Should I create a Microsoft Team, a Channel or a Private Channel?

I have a team of people working on a collection of shared objectives or projects:
- Create a Microsoft Team with a Channel for each objective or project
- Create a separate Planner for each Channel
- Create a separate OneNote section for each Channel

I have a project with different areas of focus, e.g. Development, Sales, Marketing, Support
- Create a Microsoft Team for the project
- Create a different Channel for each area of focus
- Create a single Planner and use labels to allow the tasks to be filtered for each area
- Create a separate OneNote section for each Channel

I manage a team of employees (less than 30)
- Create a Microsoft Team
- Create a Private Channel for each employee
- Add the employee to the Private Channel
- Add an HR representative as an Owner of the Private Channel
- Store files in the Private Channel that the employee is allowed to access
- Communicate in the Private Channel in relation to objectives and HR activities

## Limitations of Private Channels

I need to be able to manage tasks using Planner
- Create a standard Channel as **Private Channels do not support Planner**

I need to be able to create and manage Microsoft Forms and Power Automate Flows and share them with my team
- Create a standard Channel as **Private Channels do not support group ownership of Microsoft Forms and Power Automate Flows**

I need to be able to schedule meetings in a Channel and record them
- Create a standard Channel as **meetings cannot be scheduled to Private Channel**


## Channels

###	General Channel

- Keep this for announcements and Posts that don't fit in the other Channels

### Channel Management

- Keep the number of Channels to a minimum to avoid confusion
- Agree the naming convention for Channels when the Microsoft Team is created
- Do not rename Channels as the underlying folder in the SharePoint document library will not be updated with the new name

### Conversations

#### Profile Picture

- Upload a profile picture so that people recognise you
- The profile picture is used in chats, posts and during meetings
- If you don't have a picture, your initials will be used

#### Posts

- Click the "Compose" option for rich text and additional options such as importance and posting to multiple Channels
- Use the subject line for Posts
- Use importance sparingly so as not to "cry wolf"
- Use Announcements for increased impact of messages
- Don't expect an immediate reply - use Chat for a more immediate response
- Use the attach capability to add a link to a file that is in the Microsoft Team
- Drag a file directly into the Post to simultaneously upload it and attach it to the Post
- Use GIFs and Stickers in accordance with the general mood to the Microsoft Team

#### Mentions

- Use @[User | Channel | Microsoft Team] to ensure that the right audience sees the post
- Users will need to be showing the Microsoft Team and have notifications configured correctly but these are set by default
- Use backspace or delete to remove the surname of a user (if they are displayed as "forename surname")
- Use @ sensibly as if it is overused people will stop paying attention to it
- Try not to use @ with the Microsoft Team name or the General Channel, instead consider which Channel the post should be in and whether everyone needs to be notified or not

#### Respond to Posts

- Use emojis in the top left of a Post to indicate acknowledgement, approval or appreciation of a Post

#### Reply to Posts

- Most posts have the option to reply at the bottom of the post
- Make sure you scroll to the bottom of the screen to ensure the reply option is visible as it can be easy to create a new post instead of replying to a post
- If you accidently create a new post, delete it and put your response in as a reply where it should be

#### Activity Feed

- Regularly check the Activity Feed to see activity that has taken place in Microsoft Teams and Channels 
- Use the filters to quickly see important activity

#### Guest Users

- Don't invite guest users into a Microsoft Team without letting the members of the Microsoft Team know first
- Guest users will be able to see all content within a Microsoft Team including historical Posts

### Chat

#### 1-2-1 Chat

Chat should be ad-hoc and not related to decisions that affect a team.  If this is the case consider moving from Chat to Posts within a Microsoft Team

#### Group Chat

- Additional users can be brought into a chat to create a group chat
- Give the group chat a name if it relates to a specific subject

#### Mobile

- Use Chat in the Microsoft Teams Mobile App in the same way you would use WhatsApp
- Set Out of Hours to mute notifications when you are not working

###	Status

#### Do Not Disturb (DND)

- Change your status to DND when you are presenting or cannot be disturbed
- Check the status of other people before pushing them for a response
- Remember to reset your status if you set it to DND

#### Meetings

- The same rules for Outlook meetings apply to Microsoft Teams meetings
- Book a room with good AV capabilities if you have multiple attendees in the same location as well as remote attendees
- Use video where devices and connectivity allow
- Make use of screen share to share a presentation or desktop
- Use the chat window associated with the meeting to share links and comments
- Mute yourself if you are in a noisy location
- If possible, join meetings from a static location and not while on the train or driving
- Join meetings using the Mobile App - it will fail over to dial in if connectivity is bad and dial-in details exist in the meeting
- Use Background Blur to hide your surroundings

### Planner

- Use Planner to track task assigned in relation to the Microsoft Teams assigned to members 
- Agree the labels and buckets that will be used as a team and document them with an Announcement in the Channel where the Planner is visible
- When adding a Planner Tab and creating a new Planner, name it as “<Microsoft Team Name> - <Channel Name>” so that when the Planner name is displayed elsewhere, such as in the native Planner site, or in Microsoft To-Do, it has context
- Once a Planner Tab has been created, rename it to “Planner” so it is clear what it is

### OneNote

- Use OneNote to store notes within a Microsoft Team
- Add sections for each Channel
- Add the sections as a Tab to each Channel
- Rename the Tab to OneNote to make it clear what it is

### Microsoft Team Owners

- Ensure that there is a description for the Microsoft Team
- Ensure that at least one other person is an Owner of the Microsoft Team
