## Should I create a Microsoft Team, a Channel or a Private Channel?

I have a team of people working on a collection of shared objectives or projects:
- Create a Microsoft Team with a Channel for each objective or project
- Create a separate Planner for each Channel
- Create a separate OneNote section for each Channel
