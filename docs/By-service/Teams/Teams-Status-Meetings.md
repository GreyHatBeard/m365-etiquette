## Meetings
- The same rules for Outlook meetings apply to Microsoft Teams meetings
- Book a room with good AV capabilities if you have multiple attendees in the same location as well as remote attendees
- Use video where devices and connectivity allow
- Make use of screen share to share a presentation or desktop
- Use the chat window associated with the meeting to share links and comments
- Mute yourself if you are in a noisy location
- If possible, join meetings from a static location and not while on the train or driving
- Join meetings using the Mobile App - it will fail over to dial in if connectivity is bad and dial-in details exist in the meeting
- Use Background Blur to hide your surroundings
