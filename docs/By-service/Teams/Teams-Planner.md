## Planner
- Use Planner to track task assigned in relation to the Microsoft Teams assigned to members 
- Agree the labels and buckets that will be used as a team and document them with an Announcement in the Channel where the Planner is visible
- When adding a Planner Tab and creating a new Planner, name it as “<Microsoft Team Name> - <Channel Name>” so that when the Planner name is displayed elsewhere, such as in the native Planner site, or in Microsoft To-Do, it has context
- Once a Planner Tab has been created, rename it to “Planner” so it is clear what it is
