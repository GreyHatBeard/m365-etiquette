# Asking questions

Microsoft 365 has several ways that you could ask questions of people. The best place will often depend on the type of question.

## I have a question for a specific person

### Private question
- If it is just for that person and not related to a project or topic that others may be interested in then message them directly in Teams.

### Project or Team related question
- If the question is about a project then ask the question in the relevant Team/Channel as others may be able to answer or may be interested in the answer
- @mention the person that you hope will answer so that they are notified
- If a specific channel does not fit then use the General channel.

### Topic question
- If your organisation is using Yammer, the associated community may be the right place to ask a question so that others may be able to answer can or other may be interested in the response
- @mention the person that you hope will answer so that they are notified.

## I have a question for a project or my team
Ask the question in either a specific channel or the general channel for that Team
- If there is no response in a timely fashion, it may be helpful to tag one person who may know
- If there's still no response, you're on your own

## I have a question about a topic
- If your organisation is using Yammer, the associated community is the best place to answer
- Make the post as a question
- When you get the reply that answers your question, flag it as the best answer
