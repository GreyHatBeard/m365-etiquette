## Should I create a Microsoft Team, a Channel or a Private Channel?

I manage a team of employees (less than 30)
- Create a Microsoft Team
- Create a Private Channel for each employee
- Add the employee to the Private Channel
- Add an HR representative as an Owner of the Private Channel
- Store files in the Private Channel that the employee is allowed to access
- Communicate in the Private Channel in relation to objectives and HR activities
