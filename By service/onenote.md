# OneNote

- Share your notes as much as possible - applying permissions when needed
- Avoid creating notes locally
- Avoid too many notes in OneDrive
- Create OneNote for each project
- Create sections for each meeting
- Name pages effectively without repeating too many names unnecessarily
- Keep page names short so as to be easy to read in the sidebar
