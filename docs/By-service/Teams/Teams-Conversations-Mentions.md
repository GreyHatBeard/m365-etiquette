## Mentions
- Use @[User | Channel | Microsoft Team] to ensure that the right audience sees the post
- Users will need to be showing the Microsoft Team and have notifications configured correctly but these are set by default
- Use backspace or delete to remove the surname of a user (if they are displayed as "forename surname")
- Use @ sensibly as if it is overused people will stop paying attention to it
- Try not to use @ with the Microsoft Team name or the General Channel, instead consider which Channel the post should be in and whether everyone needs to be notified or not
