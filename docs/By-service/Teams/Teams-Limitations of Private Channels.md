## Limitations of Private Channels

I need to be able to manage tasks using Planner
- Create a standard Channel as **Private Channels do not support Planner**

I need to be able to create and manage Microsoft Forms and Power Automate Flows and share them with my team
- Create a standard Channel as **Private Channels do not support group ownership of Microsoft Forms and Power Automate Flows**

I need to be able to schedule meetings in a Channel and record them
- Create a standard Channel as **meetings cannot be scheduled to Private Channel**
