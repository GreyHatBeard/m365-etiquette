# Liking posts

- Likes on Teams and Yammer generally mean that you agree with the post
- If you want a more nuanced reply then add a reply too
- Likes can steer what content you see more of so like to say that you want more content similar to that
- Likes give the creator a little dopamine hit so there's no problems with being liberal with your likes
